Managing mobu flocks
####################

Mobu calls each test runner a "monkey" and organizes them into groups called "flocks."
You can get a list of flocks from the mobu API.
For example, on the IDF production deployment, go to `https://data.lsst.cloud/mobu/summary <https://data.lsst.cloud/mobu/summary>`_

Flocks can be also manipulated through the API.
For example, to stop a noisy flock running on ``data.lsst.cloud`` while troubleshooting is in progress, first obtain a token with ``exec:admin`` scope from the authentication service, and then:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -H 'Authorization: bearer <token>' -X DELETE https://data.lsst.cloud/mobu/flocks/tutorial

Flock configuration
===================

Configuring mobu consists primarily of defining the flocks of monkeys that it should run.
This is done by setting the ``autostart`` key in the ``values-*.yaml`` file for that deployment to a list of flock definitions.
The definition of a flock must follow the same schema as a ``PUT`` to the ``/mobu/flocks`` route to create a new flock via the API.
Complete documentation is therefore available at the ``/mobu/redoc`` route on a given deployment.
This is just an overview of the most common configurations.

Simple configuration
--------------------

Here is a simple configuration with a single flock that tests the Notebook Aspect by spawning a pod, running some Python, and then destroying the pod again:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autostart:
     - name: "python"
       count: 1
       users:
         - username: "bot-mobu-user"
       scopes: ["exec:notebook"]
       business:
         type: "JupyterPythonLoop"
         restart: true
         options:
           max_executions: 1
           code: "print(1+1)"

Important points to note here:

* The ``autostart`` key takes a list of flocks of monkeys.
  Each one must have a ``name`` (which controls the URL for that flock under ``/mobu/flocks`` once it has been created) and a ``count`` key specifying how many monkeys will be performing this test.

* Users must be defined for each monkey.
  There are two ways to do this: specifying a list of users equal to the number of monkeys being run, or providing a specification for users that is used to programmatically generate usernames, UIDs, and GIDs.
  An example of the latter will be given below.
  Here, this specifies a single user with the name ``bot-mobu-user``.
  Usernames must begin with ``bot-``.
  Neither a UID nor a GID is specified, which means that Gafaelfawr has to be ble to generate UIDs and GIDs on the fly.
  This configuration will therefore only work if this deployment enables Firestore for UID and GID generation, and enables synthesizing user private groups.

* If the monkey user will need additional scopes, they must be specified.
  Here, the required scope is ``exec:notebook``, which allows spawning Notebooks.
  More scopes would be needed if the monkey were running notebooks that interacted with other applications.

* The ``business.type`` key specifies the type of test to perform.
  Here, ``JupyterPythonLoop`` just runs a small bit of Python through the Jupyter lab API after spawning a lab pod.
  ``options.code`` can be used to specify the Python code to be run in the loop.
  See the full mobu documentation for more details.

* ``restart: true`` tells mobu to shut down and respawn the pod if there is any failure.
  The default is to attempt to keep using the same pod despite the failure.

Starting monkeys in batches
---------------------------

In situations, you may want to start monkeys in a flock in batches with time in between each batch, rather than all at once.
Load testing notebook business monkeys is a good example of this, where starting a large number of these monkeys might overwhelm JupyterHub.

You can use add ``start_batch_size`` and ``start_batch_wait`` parameters to a flock configuration to do this.

``start_batch_size`` specifies how many monkeys should be started in each batch, and ``start_batch_wait`` specifies how long to wait in between starting each batch.

.. code-block:: yaml

   autostart:
     - name: "python"
       count: 10
       start_batch_size: 2
       start_batch_wait: "60s"
       users:
         - username: "bot-mobu-user"
       scopes: ["exec:notebook"]
       business:
         type: "JupyterPythonLoop"
         restart: true
         options:
           max_executions: 1
           code: "print(1+1)"

Testing with notebooks
----------------------

Here is a more complex example that runs a set of notebooks as a test:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autostart:
     - name: "firefighter"
       count: 1
       users:
         - username: "bot-mobu-recommended"
           uidnumber: 74768
           gidnumber: 74768
       scopes:
         - "exec:notebook"
         - "exec:portal"
         - "read:image"
         - "read:tap"
       business:
         type: "NotebookRunnerCounting"
         options:
           repo_url: "https://github.com/lsst-sqre/system-test.git"
           repo_ref: "prod"
           max_executions: 1
         restart: true

Here, note that the UID and primary GID for the user are specified, so this example will work in deployments that do not use Firestore and synthesized user private groups.

This uses the business ``NotebookRunner`` instead, which checks out a Git repository and runs all notebooks in that repository, at the top level and any directories and subdirectories.

The repository URL and branch are configured in ``options``.
``options.max_executions: 1`` tells mobu to shut down and respawn the pod after each notebook.
This exercises pod spawning more frequently, but does not test the lab's ability to run a long series of notebooks.
One may wish to run multiple flocks in a given environment with different configurations for ``max_executions``.
These notebooks need more scopes, so those scopes are specified.

Here is a different example that runs multiple monkeys in a flock:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autostart:
     - name: "firefighter"
       count: 5
       user_spec:
         username_prefix: "bot-mobu-recommended"
         uid_start: 74768
         gid_start: 74768
       scopes:
         - "exec:notebook"
         - "exec:portal"
         - "read:image"
         - "read:tap"
       business:
         type: "NotebookRunnerCounting"
         options:
           repo_url: "https://github.com/lsst-sqre/system-test.git"
           repo_ref: "prod"
           max_executions: 1
         restart: true

This is almost identical except that it specifies five monkeys and provides a specification for creating the users instead of specifying each user.
The users will be assigned consecutive UIDs and GIDs starting with the specified ``uid_start`` and ``gid_start``.
The usernames will be formed by adding consecutive digits to the end of the ``username_prefix``.

Testing TAP
-----------

Here is an example of testing the TAP application:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autostart:
     - name: "tap"
       count: 1
       users:
         - username: "bot-mobu-tap"
           uidnumber: 74775
           gidnumber: 74775
       scopes: ["read:tap"]
       business:
         type: "TAPQueryRunner"
         restart: true
         options:
           sync: true
           query_set: "dp0.2"

Note that ``business.type`` is set to ``TAPQueryRunner`` instead.
``options.sync`` can choosen between sync and async queries, and ``options.query_set`` can be used to specify the query set to run.
