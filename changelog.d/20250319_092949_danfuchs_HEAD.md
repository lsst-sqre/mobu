### New features

- Multiple replicas of mobu can be run in an environment. The number of monkeys specified in a flock's `count` will be spread evenly across all replicas. Note that this comes with certain restrictions, see [the docs](https://mobu.lsst.io/user-guide/multiple-replicas.html) for details.

### Bug fixes

- One period of `execution_idle_time` elapses after trying to execute a notebook with no code cells, instead of not waiting at all.
