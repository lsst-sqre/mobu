### Other changes

- All environment variables used to configure mobu now start with `MOBU_`, and several have changed their names. The new settings are `MOBU_ALERT_HOOK`, `MOBU_AUTOSTART_PATH`, `MOBU_ENVIRONMENT_URL`, `MOBU_GAFAELFAWR_TOKEN`, `MOBU_NAME`, `MOBU_PATH_PREFIX`, `MOBU_LOGGING_PROFILE`, and `MOBU_LOG_LEVEL`. This is handled by the Phalanx application, so no configuration changes should be required.
