### New features

- mobu now uses httpx instead of aiohttp for all HTTP requests (including httpx-ws for WebSocket connections and httpx-sse for EventStream connections) and makes use of the Safir framework for parsing and reporting HTTP client exceptions. Alerts for failing web requests will be somewhat different and hopefully clearer.
