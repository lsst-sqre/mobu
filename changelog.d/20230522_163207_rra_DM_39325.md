### Bug fixes

- When reporting errors to Slack, mobu 5.0.0 mistakenly started stripping ANSI escape sequences from the code being executed, which should be safe since it comes from local notebooks or configuration, instead of the error output, which is where Jupyter labs like to add formatting. Strip ANSI escape sequences from the error output instead of the code.
