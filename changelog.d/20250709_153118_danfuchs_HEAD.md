### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The GitHub Mobu CI app now listens to `pull_request` events instead of `check_suite` and `check_run` events. When this version of mobu is deployed to an environment, the app permissions and subscribed events  in the `Permission & Events` tab of the Developer Settings for the app need to be modified.

  The permissions in the `Repository permissions` accordian section need to be changed:
  - In the `Pull requests` row, change the `Access` drop-down to `Read-only`

  The events in `Subscribe to events` section of the `Permissions & Events` tab have to be changed:
  - Uncheck the `Check run` box
  - Uncheck the `Check suite` box
  - Check the `Pull request` box

  This fixes a bug where a Mobu CI job would never run when a PR was opened.
