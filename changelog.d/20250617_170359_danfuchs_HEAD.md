### New features

- Make notebook filtering simpler and more flexible.

  * Deprecate `exclude_dirs`
  * Add `collection_rules` to every notebookrunner business, not just `NotebookRunnerList`

  `collection_rules` looks like this:

  ```yaml
     collection_rules:
       - type: "exclude_union_of"
         patterns:
           - "not-these/**"
           - "not/these/either/**"
       - type: "intersect_union_of"
         patterns:
           - "this.ipynb"
           - "these/**"
           - "also/these**"
       - type: "intersect_union_of"
         patterns:
           - "**/these-*"
  ```

  Each entry is a pattern using the [Python pathlib glob pattern language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib-pattern-language)

* Start with all notebooks in the repo.
* For each collection rule, remove notebooks:
  * Intersect rules will remove notebooks that are not in the
    intersection of:
      * The current set
      * The union of the matched patterns.
  * Exclude rules will remove notebooks from the current set that are
    in the union of the matched patterns.
* Remove any remaining notebooks that require unavailable services.
