### New features

- Make notebook filtering simpler and more flexible.

  * Deprecate `exclude_dirs`
  * Add `collection_rules` to every notebookrunner business, not just `NotebookRunnerList`

  `collection_rules` looks like this:

  ```yaml
     collection_rules:
       - type: "exclude"
         patterns:
           - "not-these/**"
           - "not/these/either/**"
       - type: "include"
         patterns:
           - "this.ipynb"
           - "these/**"
           - "also/these**"
       - type: "include"
         patterns:
           - "**/these-*"
  ```

  Each entry is a pattern using the [Python pathlib glob pattern language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib-pattern-language)

  * If no include rules are specified, start with all notebooks.
  * For every include rule:
    * Get the set of all of the notebooks matched by any pattern.
  * Take the intersection of all of those sets.
  * Subtract any notebook matched by an exclude pattern.
  * Subtract any notebook that specifies required services that are missing.
