### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The `NotebookRunner` buisiness has been split into two different businesses: `NotebookRunnerCounting` and `NotebookRunnerList`. The difference is that `NotebookRunnerCounting` takes the `max_executions` option that refreshes the lab after that number of notebook executions, and `NotebookRunnerList` takes the `notebooks_to_run` option, which runs all of the notebooks in that list before refreshing. Currently, `NotebookRunnerList` is only used by the GitHub CI functionality.
  - Any references to `NotebookRunner` in any flock config need to be changed to to one of these new businesses, almost certainly `NotebookRunnerCounting`.
