# mobu

mobu (short for "monkey business") is a test framework for the [Rubin Science Platform](https://phalanx.lsst.io/).
It attempts to simulate user interactions with Science Platform services continuously, recording successes and failures and optionally reporting failures to a Slack channel via a Slack incoming webhook.
It can be used for both monitoring and synthetic load testing.

mobu is developed with the [Safir](https://safir.lsst.io/) framework.

See [mobu.lsst.io](https://mobu.lsst.io) for full documentation.
